# Checkers Game In C

Welcome to the Checkers Game in C! This program allows you to play the classic game of Checkers against a computer opponent. Here, you'll find a brief explanation of the game rules and an example board to get you started.

## Game Rules

Checkers is a two-player strategy game played on a square board divided into cells. Each player starts with 12 pieces, either black or white. The goal is to capture all of your opponent's pieces or block them so they cannot make any more moves.

- Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally forward.
- Normal pieces can only move forward, while King pieces can move both forward and backward.
- A piece can capture an opponent's piece by jumping over it diagonally, landing on the empty cell immediately after the opponent's piece.
- If a piece reaches the last row of the opponent's side, it becomes a King.
- Kings can move and capture in any diagonal direction.

The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent's pieces or blocks them from making any legal moves.

## Example Board

Here's an example of the game board, with '-' representing the borders of each cell and the players represented by 'T' and 'B' for the top and bottom players, respectively:

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| A |   | T |   | T |   | T |   | T |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| B | T |   | T |   | T |   | T |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| C |   | T |   | T |   | T |   | T |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| H | B |   | B |   | B |   | B |   |

In this example, the black pieces are represented by 'B', and the white pieces are represented by 'T'. The board consists of an 8x8 grid, and each player starts with 12 pieces placed in alternating cells.
